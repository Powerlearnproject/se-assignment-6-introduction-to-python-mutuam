               Scientific Computing and Research

B.Installing Python:

Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
  Installing Python
   Windows:
           Download Python
           Run the Installer
           Complete the Installation

   macOS:
         Install Python via Homebrew (optional)
         Download Python
         Run the Installer

  Linux:
       Use Package Manager
       Verify Installation

C.Python Syntax and Semantics:

Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

         print("Hello, World!")

         Explanation of Basic Syntax Elements:
             Print Statement (print()):
             String Literal ("Hello, World!"):

D.Data Types and Variables:

List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

In Python, the basic data types include:
         Integer (int):Represents whole numbers without any fractional part
         Float (float):Represents numbers with a decimal point
         String (str):Represents a sequence of characters enclosed within quotes
         Boolean (bool): Represents a truth value, either True or False
         List:Represents an ordered collection of items, which can be of different data types.
         Tuple:Similar to a list but is immutable
         Dictionary (dict): Represents a collection of key-value pairs

    Here's a short script demonstrating how to create and use variables of different data types in Python:
         # Define variables of different data types
# Integer
age = 25

# Float
pi = 3.14159

# String
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean
is_student = True

# List
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Dictionary
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'is_student': False}

# Print out the variables
print("Age:", age)
print("Pi:", pi)
print("Name:", name)
print("Is student?", is_student)
print("Fruits:", fruits)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates)
print("Person:", person)


E.Control Structures:

Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an if-else statement and a for loop.

  Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The primary conditional statements in Python are if, elif (short for "else if"), and else.

    # Example of an if-else statement
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not yet an adult.")


Loops:
Loops are used to iterate over a sequence of items or execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met.

   # Example of a for loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

F.Functions in Python:

What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions in Python are blocks of organized, reusable code that perform a specific task.

Key Features and Benefits of Functions:
    Modularity
    Code Reusability
    Abstraction
    Parameter Passing
   Here's a Python function that takes two arguments (numbers) and returns their sum:

    # Define a function to calculate the sum of two numbers
def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example of calling the function
result = sum_two_numbers(3, 5)
print("Sum:", result)

G.Lists and Dictionaries:

Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   list are ordered collections while dictionaries are unordered collections 
   Lists are defined using square brackets  while dictionaries are defined using curly braces 
   Elements in a list are accessed by their index while  elements in a dictionary are accessed by their keys


   # Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 30,
    'city': 'New York'
}

# Print the original list and dictionary
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Original dictionary:", person)

# Accessing elements
print("\nAccessing elements:")
print("Third number in the list:", numbers[2])  # Accessing the third element in the list (index 2)
print("Age of the person:", person['age'])     # Accessing value associated with the key 'age' in the dictionary

# Modifying elements
print("\nModifying elements:")
numbers[0] = 10  # Change the first element of the list
person['city'] = 'San Francisco'  # Change the value associated with the key 'city' in the dictionary
print("Updated list:", numbers)
print("Updated dictionary:", person)

# Adding new elements
print("\nAdding new elements:")
numbers.append(6)  # Append a new number to the end of the list
person['gender'] = 'Female'  # Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary
print("List after appending:", numbers)
print("Dictionary after adding new key-value pair:", person)

# Removing elements
print("\nRemoving elements:")
removed_number = numbers.pop(1)  # Remove and return the element at index 1 from the list
removed_city = person.pop('city')  # Remove and return the value associated with the key 'city' from the dictionary
print("Removed number from list:", removed_number)
print("List after removal:", numbers)
print("Removed city from dictionary:", removed_city)
print("Dictionary after removal:", person)


H.Exception Handling:

What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use try, except, and finally blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows you to gracefully manage and respond to errors that occur during program execution.


# Example of exception handling in Python

try:
    # Try block: Attempt to perform operations that may raise exceptions
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Try to convert user input to an integer
    result = 10 / x  # Try to perform division
    print("Result:", result)  # Print the result if successful

except ValueError:
    # Handle ValueError (e.g., user inputs a non-integer)
    print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")

except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Handle ZeroDivisionError (e.g., division by zero)
    print("Error: Division by zero.")

finally:
    # Finally block: Always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
    print("Execution completed.")

# Example usage:
# If user inputs 0, it will trigger a ZeroDivisionError and print an error message,
# followed by "Execution completed." Output


I.Modules and Packages:

Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the math module.

A module in Python is a file containing Python definitions (functions, classes, variables) and statements while  a package in Python is a hierarchical file directory structure that contains modules and sub-packages.

# Example of importing and using the math module

import math  # Import the math module

# Using functions from the math module
print("Value of pi:", math.pi)  # Accessing the constant pi from math
print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))  # Using the sqrt() function to calculate square root
print("Factorial of 5:", math.factorial(5))  # Using the factorial() function to calculate factorial

# Using constants and functions directly (without prefixing with math)
print("Value of e:", math.e)  # Accessing the constant e from math directly
print("Cosine of pi/4:", math.cos(math.pi / 4))  # Using math functions directly

J.File I/O:

How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
Reading from a File:
  Open the File
  Read the Content
  Close the File


     # Reading from a file and printing its content

# Specify the file path
file_path = 'example.txt'

try:
    # Open the file in read mode
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the entire content of the file
        content = file.read()
        # Print the content
        print("Content of the file:")
        print(content)

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' does not exist.")

except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error: Unable to read the file '{file_path}'. {e}")
